    <h1>Jessa Grefaldo Palero</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Born on November 6, 2003, in a small suburban town, Jessa was the youngest of seven siblings and grew up in a loving but modest household. From an early age, Jessa stood out for her insatiable curiosity. She wasn’t the kind of child who accepted simple answers; she always wanted to know the "why" behind everything. Whether she was questioning her parents about the world or staying up late watching horror or action movies, her fascination with human behavior began early. She loved asking deeper questions about people’s choices and motivations. This curiosity was fueled further by her love of crime documentaries, where the complex intersections of psychology and justice fascinated her. 

    Jessa’s high school years weren’t without challenges. She struggled to balance her academic ambitions with her personal life, often torn between being a perfectionist and wanting to enjoy her teenage years. Still, her resilience and determination set her apart. By the time she graduated in 2021, Jessa had discovered her path. Criminology, she realized, was the perfect field for her—a place where her interests in human behavior, justice, and critical thinking could converge. With excitement and determination, she embarked on the next phase of her journey in college. 

    Now, as a criminology student, Jessa spends her days immersed in lectures on criminal law, and late-night study sessions. She thrives on understanding the complexities of crime and justice. Despite her rigorous academic schedule, Jessa has found ways to balance her life. Reading has become one of her favorite pastimes, offering her a way to process her thoughts and explore ideas beyond her coursework. She also enjoys listening to music, which helps her recharge and reflect on her goals. 

    Looking to the future, Jessa is clear about her ambitions. She dreams of a career where she can make a meaningful impact, whether as a forensic analyst, a criminal investigator, or an advocate for justice system reform. For her, criminology isn’t just about solving crimes; it’s about understanding the root causes of wrongdoing and contributing to a fairer and safer society. 

    Jessa, born on a crisp November day in 2003, has come a long way. What began as a childhood curiosity has blossomed into a lifelong passion for uncovering the truth and making a difference. Her journey is just beginning, but her determination ensures it will be a purposeful and impactful one.</p>
